2143 -  the project runs. Very cool.

2145 -  brainstorming and creating information about my Pen Company, created text file to keep track of ideas
		PenCompany.txt
2251 -  Company branding decided. Comitting.

2329 -  App wasn't working the way I wanted it, so I restarted. Copied .txt files to new project. Recommit.

	20221008

1859 -  Welcome back for the day! Lets see what we can get done!
2137 -  Got slightly distracted playing Overwatch 2. It's been good so far
		Anyway. Seeded the Database with my pen offerings

2345 -  Working on the search function.

	20221010
0005 -  Checking if the search function works.
0006 -  Search function works!
		Committing to Github
0051 -  Used the genre search tutorial in Step 7 (Add Search) to create a pen tip size search function
0136 -  testing the pentipsize search function
0137 -  It works! 
		Committing to GitHub
0139 -  Beginning work on adding the Rating function
		Unsure of how to tackle this... Does it need to be interactive?
1742 -  Unsure of how to proceed with rating, going to work on the about me page. 
		This is gonna be funny.
1958 -  Finished coding HTML/CSS in VSCode for my employee page
		Everything seems to be working except my images
2214 -  Got images working using the ~/ file thingy to access the wwwroot folder
		Finished up the entirety of the About Us page.
		Committing to GitHub
2244 -  Images added as a string to the database so it's easier to show them on the products page

YET TO DO:
	Star Rating system
		Does it need to be interactive? No
	Design product page ✓
	Navigation design
	Colour scheme adjustments. 
	Filter Button (see 20221011 2109)

2055 -  Have been working on product page in vs code, I think I have something I like
		so I'm fiddling with it here to add all the mvc stuff
		So far I have gotten the new search bar, and the new create product button working. 
2056 -  Starting work on filter button
		Intent of Filter button is to act as the dropdown for the 'pen tip size' thing I made
		Should I add more ways to filter? That'll be a major b. We'll see how I fell about that
2109 -  Filter button is displaying correct information, but isn't actually executing the search
		Unsure of how to fix
2110 -  I'm going to try to sort out my items on the page now
2117 -  Okay I put in my @foreach and called my database names... moment of truth...
		Please work.
2118 -  IT WORKS!
		Well. The images dont. But I knew I'd have to fiddle with that. 
		But the information is displayed and all the pens are loaded!
		For some reason the page isn't scrolling though. Gonna have to fix that. I think I know what it is
2120 -  I was right about the scroll issue. I'm a silly billy I had html {height: 100%;}
		There is an html override on that page for the background though cause I'm fancy
2137 -  Can't get the images to show so I'm gonna try something that involves reseeding the database
		Which is something I was trying to avoid but w/e
2145 -  Got the images working. Apparently the entire folder path isn't something that the program can handle
		And since the "~/images/product/" is the same, I just removed that from the image string :)
		BUT the erasable checkbox is a little hard to read so I might wiggle that
2148 -  Changed the erasable display to an if/else party for now. It looks way better
		The font is a little light though for the name, might have to make that a little more readable
2151 -  Much better.
		Committing cause I made a lot of changes so far.
